    <h3>Hi Julia, we've been together for over 6 months at this and thats 
        a pretty long time. We've taken so many pictures and down below 
        are only a few of the pictures that I really like. I love taking 
        our silly little pictures whether we're making funny faces or 
        holding our thumbs up to the camera right before we eat. I love
        taking them because they're with YOU. Thank you for all of the wonderful
        experiences that we've had together and I can't wait to have many
        more. I really am grateful for everything that we're able to do together
        and I can't wait to see whats in store for us in the future. <3
    </h3>
