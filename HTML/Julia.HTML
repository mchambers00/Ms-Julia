        <h3>Hi Julia, this is our first Valentine's Day together and I hope to make it a special one.
        I've been making this website for you for a little bit now, and since I've written so many
        cards recently I thought that maybe a website would be a little change of pace. I love you
        so much and I am eternally grateful and appreciative of you. You're the rock in my life 
        and I couldn't imagine the past 6 months (+ 6 days) without you. I can't wait for many
        more milestones and growth for the both of us. I can't wait to spend this time with you 
        my love, my honey, my pretty lady, my Julia, my equal. Happy Valentine's day dear, you
        deserve to be treated like a goddess and a queen because you most definitely are one.
        Please click some of the navigation bars at the top to see what I have made for you! :D !
         </h3>
