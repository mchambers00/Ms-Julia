        <H3>Hi Julia, this page is dedicated to
            reassuring you during those times that you
            can't reassure yourself. I love you so much
            and this page will remind you of the saying Koi
            No Yokan, my favorite Japanese phrase. Re-read all
            of the cards that I've written you, or text/call me whenever
            you need some reassurance and I'll always drop everything
            and answer. :D 
        </H3>
